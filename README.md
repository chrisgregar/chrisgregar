- Hi, I’m @chrisgregar. I'm a recently graduated mechanical engineer trying to transition to software development.
- I’m primarily interested in backend development, however I'm pretty new to all this. I'm just trying to become proficient and make a career change.
- I’m currently learning Java, however I also have some experience with Python. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much any projects!
- Contact me at chrisgregar@gmail.com.
